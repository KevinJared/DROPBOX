### Objectives
* **Recreate** the page on the dropbox.png as closely as possible
* Have a log-in **pop-up modal** when the page first loads that takes in the user's information
  - The modal should have input fields that take the users **name** and **email**
  - The user's name and email will be stored in an **object** and displayed in the top right where there is _Eddie Lobanovskiy_
  - The user's email will only be visible in a **dropdown** when the user clicks on their name
* When the user hovers over an image, it should appear like the image titled 'Waiting for the trian.png' on the example image

N.B. *The objectives that are bolded are very important, make sure **all** of them are completed*
